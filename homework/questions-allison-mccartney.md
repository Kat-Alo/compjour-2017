## Questions

### 1. V3 Tool

V3 addresses a need within the industry and equips journalists to better communicate with the public. How did you identify this need? What was the process like getting this project funded and working together on the team? What do you think could be the next big digital tool to help journalists?

### 2. Reformatting government data to make it usable

[The Lost & Found Investigative project](https://lostandfound.revealnews.org/) and the Open Contractors project both display already-available data but in a way that allows stories and information to be discoverable. How do you determine whether a data set is worth investing the time in creating similar applications? What do you take into consideration when deciding which tools users will likely need available to search the data sets? Are there any others for which you are considering working on a similar project?

### 3. Experience at Stanford as a journalism M.A.

What courses and experiences as a Stanford graduate student do you think best equipped you for working in journalism? What skills did you learn that made you a more competitive candidate for positions and projects you applied for? Do you have any dang-I-wish-I-had-done-X from your time at Stanford?

### 5. SF Taquerias

In your About page, you wrote:
> During the day, I split my time between working at the Brown Institute for Media Innovation at Stanford and on various data and graphics freelance projects. Nights, I’m either teaching at UC Berkeley, figure drawing or touring San Francisco’s Mission District taquerias.
How do you feel about the taqueria scene in SF? What are your favorite spots? Do they have good vegetarian options?
