## Questions

### 1. Spotlight: not overlooking the story

An important theme in the movie seems to be guilt. There is a scene in particular where Mark Ruffalo discusses being raised in Boston, with the heavy Catholic presence. Everyone on the Spotlight team is baffled and reflecting on the role church-going played in their upbringing. I think Baron's disruption of the team's work highlights the importance of diversity in the newsroom--not just of race and gender, but also background and religion. The movie touches on why the paper had not previously looked into the Catholic church, and why the dots were never properly connected. Looking back, what lessons are there to be learned in order to not overlook a story? How can reporters avoid normalizing something that is newsworthy; especially when reporting on their hometowns?

### 2. Spotlight: hollywood and journalism

Spotlight brought the importance of investigative reporting to a broader audience. According to [this Poynter article](https://www.poynter.org/2016/how-the-san-francisco-chronicle-rebuilt-its-investigative-team/441213/), the new SF Chronical investigative team is, in part, a result of the right publisher seeing the film. Are there any other results of the film that you've seen in the field--positive or negative? Do people have a better or more skewed view of work in the newsroom after seeing Spotlight? Do you think Hollywood and other popular media could help investigative reporting in other ways?

### 3. Education

After leaving the Globe, you worked at MIT in their media lab, and now at Northeastern University. Why did you decide to redirect your career path from the newsroom to the classroom? What has kept you in education? Have you noted any changes in your classes and/or teaching since the transition to the Trump administration?

### 4. Spotlight: story intuition

In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abTVTf9jNFI), at 1:53, Martin Baron is asking the Spotlight team to dig even further than their current findings, although they were already compelling. According to the film, Baron wanted the team to demonstrate that the abuse of children in the Catholic church was "systemic." Obviously, this push for the story paid off, but how would you explain this intuition for story discovery? When, in your mind, do you have the story? How compelling must the data be before a publication should run the story?

### 5. Data journalism and costs of story discovery

There have been many technological advances in record keeping, data discovery and data analysis since breaking the infamous Spotlight story. What has that meant for your job, both in the field as a data journalist and as an educator of the next batch of journalists? How do you see computational journalism playing a role in better public affairs reporting? What do the next data journalists need to be equipped with to keep financially struggling newsrooms alive?
